<p>One of my favorite blogs is <a href='http://usesthis.com/'>The Setup</a>. They feature various people that use computers in one way or another to do their job and simply ask them what their setup is. Well since they haven&#8217;t asked me what my setup is yet (not realizing that I&#8217;m kind of a big deal) I&#8217;m going to just post this on my own.</p>

<h3 id='id37'>#</h3>

<h4 id='who_are_you_and_what_do_you_do_im_a_software_engineer_i_have_worked_mostly_for_telecommunications_companies'>Who are you, and what do you do? I&#8217;m a software engineer. I have worked mostly for telecommunications companies.</h4>

<p>The most challenging job I had was leading up a small but capable development team responsible for routing phone calls, including geo-spatial 911 traffic. This was at a startup without much support.</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;m a Senior Engineer at Time Warner Cable. My home office is in Denver, Colorado but I work remote in Lafayette, Louisiana. I fly back about once a month. The team I&#8217;m on works on the services that IP devices use to get streaming television content.</p>

My main computer is a MacBookPro 15&#8221; from 2010. I also have a MacPro Desktop. Each computer has a 27&#8221; Thunderbolt Display. I was skeptical at first but the Apple Magic Mouse is an amazing piece of equipment. I use 1 standard keyboard for the desktop but primarily I use the bluetooth keyboard. I wouldn&#8217;t mind having the bigger size but the travel from home keys to the mouse seems like an eternity compared to the bluetooth keyboard.</h4>

<p>I also have an iPad 2 for work. I use it to validate software releases, cable channel updates. I also have an Asus Transformer to do the same thing on the Android platform. I don&#8217;t write the client code but the team I&#8217;m on is responsible for many of the back end services that these devices talk to.</p>

<p>My phone is an LG P999 Android phone. Works great, has all the apps I need; Evernote, Pandora, Dropbox, Google Reader.</p>

<h4 id='and_what_software_i_run_macos_on_both_machines_the_laptop_is_106_the_desktop_is_107_i_hear_so_much_griping_about_upgrading_the_os_that_i_dont_mind_waiting_a_while_until_the_kinks_get_worked_out_before_going_to_the_mac_a_few_years_ago_i_was_strictly_a_linux_user_it_has_been_a_smooth_transition_to_the_mac_i_still_feel_comfortable_whenever_i_go_back_to_linux_if_apple_gets_too_stupid_ill_probably_switch_back'>And what software? I run MacOS on both machines. The laptop is 10.6, the desktop is 10.7. I hear so much griping about upgrading the OS that I don&#8217;t mind waiting a while until the kinks get worked out. Before going to the Mac a few years ago I was strictly a Linux user. It has been a smooth transition to the Mac. I still feel comfortable whenever I go back to Linux. If Apple gets too stupid I&#8217;ll probably switch back.</h4>

<p>I spend most of my time in the IDE. I run <a href='http://www.eclipse.org/'>Eclipse</a> with the <a href='http://scala-ide.org/'>Scala-IDE</a> plugin. I also use a code coverage plugin for Eclipse that can handle Scala called <a href='https://github.com/jmhofer/eCobertura'>eCobertura</a>.</p>

<p>Despite having an IDE I spend a lot of my time in the console, for that I use <a href='http://iterm.sourceforge.net/'>iTerm</a>. Being a long-time VIM user I&#8217;m thankful for <a href='https://code.google.com/p/macvim/'>MacVim</a>, it&#8217;s a great distribution of VIM. I use <a href='http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/'>Homebrew</a> for installing commandline tools that are missing from the Mac. At work and in my personal development we use <a href='http://git-scm.com/'>git</a> exclusively. On my desktop I run <a href='http://jenkins-ci.org/'>Jenkins</a> for continuous integration. It polls the git repository on my laptop and our remote GitHub Enterprise servers at work. It continuously compiles our code, runs tests and generates reports.</p>

<p>When using a browser for development I will typically use Chrome. The Chrome plugins I use are for either maintaining privacy or doing software development. I use Poster, Edit this Cookie, AdBlock, Chrome Nanny, Ghostery, Time Tracker, Evernote and <a href='https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/https-everywhere/gcbommkclmclpchllfjekcdonpmejbdp'>HTTPS Everywhere</a>.</p>

<p>I use <a href='http://www.share-mouse.com/'>ShareMouse</a> to make both computers and monitors feel like one big computer. The price is right (free in my case) but it&#8217;s occasionally glitchy.</p>

<p>For remote work these come in handy: <a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/time-zones/id448041594?mt=12'>TimeZone</a>, <a href='http://beta.skype.com/en/'>Skype</a> and <a href='https://join.me/'>join.me</a> for impromptu screen sharing</p>

<p>I use <a href='https://evernote.com/'>Evernote</a> to keep track of information, <a href='https://www.dropbox.com/'>DropBox</a> to sync files, Pomodoro on occasion to focus, <a href='http://stereopsis.com/flux/'>f.lux</a> to save my eyes when working after dark, <a href='http://www.alfredapp.com/'>Alfred</a> as an app launcher and searcher, <a href='http://markedapp.com/'>Marked</a> for previewing MarkDown files. <a href='http://mindnode.com/'>MindNode</a> to create mind maps, <a href='http://www.pandabarapp.com/'>PandaBar</a> to make listening to Pandora radio not depend on Adobe Air (WTF) and <a href='https://github.com/fikovnik/ShiftIt'>ShiftIt</a> to easily organize windows.</p>

Pretty much my same setup but with more RAM. Maybe some SSDs. The Scala compiler does a lot of work for you so you need top end hardware when you&#8217;re doing any Scala project that is beyond trivial. Although our own informal analysis at work seems to indicate that SSDs don&#8217;t buy you too much for building Scala code, seems that good old fashioned RAM and processor speed is what you need..</h4>

<p>Other than that I&#8217;d like to have a screaming ThinkPad or AlienWare laptop running some <a href='http://www.debian.org/'>Debian</a> Linux variant.</p>
