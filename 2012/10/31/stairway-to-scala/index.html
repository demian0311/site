<p>The team I am on at Time Warn Cable has been doing Scala for almost a year now. 5 of us flew out to San Francisco to attend Stairway to Scala training.</p>

<p>The training was great, I really enjoyed the style of having 2 instructors. One of them doing traditional lessons and the other one would work on the REPL. To engineers things are more real when you can see running code. It&#8217;s obvious that Dick and Bill put lots of effort into the curriculum.</p>

<p>I recommend the training. Dick Wall and Bill Venners are awesome instructors. The Time Warner Cable crew was pretty punchy and the instructors managed to keep their cool.</p>
